# Shooter
Simple game about "space" shooting, school project

Technologies: C++, SFML

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04. Code::Blocks was used as an IDE.

NOTE: Remember to extract boost.7z, if you want to compile the project. I compressed those files, because of their enormous size.

NOTE2: SFML headers were edited by me to support serialization (from boost lib), so it is important to use SFML files from this project. I know that is not perfect solution, but it worked for this kind of project just fine.
